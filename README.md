For detailed usage instructions and naming conventions, see the [Image Uploads README](/public/uploads/README.md).

## Localization Best Practices

The website is fully internationalized with support for English and Spanish. Follow these guidelines when adding new content to ensure proper localization.

### Localization Structure

- **File Organization**: Translations are stored in JSON files in the `/locales` directory:
  - `en.json` - English translations
  - `es.json` - Spanish translations

- **JSON Structure**: Translation files follow a nested object structure that mirrors the site organization:
  ```json
  {
    "meta": { /* SEO metadata */ },
    "navigation": { /* Navigation labels */ },
    "home": {
      "hero": { /* Hero section content */ },
      "services": { /* Services section content */ },
      /* Other homepage sections */
    },
    /* Other page namespaces */
  }
  ```

- **Maintaining Parallel Structure**: When adding new content, ensure both language files have identical object structures with keys matching exactly.

### Adding New Content

1. **Always Add to Both Language Files**: When adding new content, update both `en.json` and `es.json` files with parallel structures.

2. **For Simple Text Content**:
   ```json
   // en.json
   "buttonLabel": "Contact Us"
   
   // es.json
   "buttonLabel": "ContÃ¡ctenos"
   ```

3. **For Structured Content** (arrays, objects):
   ```json
   // en.json
   "items": [
     {
       "id": 1,
       "title": "Our Services",
       "description": "Learn about our services"
     }
   ]
   
   // es.json
   "items": [
     {
       "id": 1,
       "title": "Nuestros Servicios",
       "description": "Conozca nuestros servicios"
     }
   ]
   ```

4. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Define interfaces for structured content to ensure type safety:
   ```typescript
   interface ServiceItem {
     id: number;
     title: string;
     description: string;
   }
   ```

### Component Implementation

1. **Basic Translation Usage**:
   ```tsx
   import { useTranslations } from 'next-intl';
   
   export default function MyComponent() {
     const t = useTranslations('namespace');
     
     return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
   }
   ```

2. **Accessing Structured Data**:
   ```tsx
   // For arrays or objects, use t.raw() with proper type casting
   const items = t.raw('items') as ServiceItem[];
   
   // Always include fallbacks for optional properties
   <span>{item.rating || 5}/5</span>
   ```

3. **Type Safety with TypeScript**:
   ```tsx
   // Define interfaces for complex data structures
   interface LocationDetails {
     title: string;
     address: string;
     // ... other properties
   }
   
   // Use type assertion for raw data
   const location = t.raw('location') as unknown as LocationDetails;
   ```

4. **Avoiding Hard-Coded Strings**: Never include hard-coded text directly in components. Always use the translation system:
   ```tsx
   // Wrong
   <button>Submit</button>
   
   // Right
   <button>{t('submit')}</button>
   ```

### Testing and Maintenance

1. **Verify Completeness**: Regularly compare language files to ensure all keys present in one are also present in the other.

2. **Test Both Languages**: When adding new features, always test the application in both English and Spanish.

3. **Language Toggle Testing**: Test the language toggle functionality to ensure content updates correctly when switching languages.

4. **Key Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive, hierarchical key names that reflect the content's location and purpose:
   ```
   home.services.title
   about.team.description
   contact.form.submitButton
   ```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id
   CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   ```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site.

### Build

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Generate test coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Deployment

The site can be deployed to Vercel or Google Cloud.

#### Vercel Deployment

To deploy this project to Vercel:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. The project includes a `vercel.json` configuration file that sets up:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Install Command: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

No additional configuration is needed as the `vercel.json` file handles the build settings automatically.

> **Note:** The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is required due to dependency conflicts between React 19 and some testing libraries that expect React 18.

#### Forcing Vercel to Deploy Latest Changes

If Vercel is not deploying the latest commit, you can use the included script to force a new deployment:

```bash
./force-vercel-deploy.sh
```

This script creates a small change that triggers a new commit and push, forcing Vercel to recognize and deploy the latest version of your code.

#### Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

If you encounter dependency conflicts during deployment, try one of these solutions:

1. Use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag in your install command
2. Ensure type definitions (`@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`) are compatible with your testing libraries
3. For local development, you can use `npm install --force` to bypass peer dependency checks

#### ESLint Errors During Deployment

The project includes a solution for handling ESLint errors related to unused variables during Vercel deployment:

1. Deployment-specific versions of files with ESLint errors are stored in the `vercel-deploy` directory
2. A prebuild script (`scripts/prepare-vercel-build.cjs`) copies these files to the correct locations before the build process starts
3. The original files are kept in the repository for future development but are ignored during deployment using `.vercelignore`

For more details, see the README in the `vercel-deploy` directory.

#### TypeScript Errors in Next.js 15

Next.js 15 introduced a breaking change where `params` and `searchParams` are now Promises rather than synchronous objects. This affects pages that use these properties, particularly in the `generateMetadata` function and page components.

The deployment-specific versions of the about, contact, legal/accessibility, and legal/disclaimer pages have been updated to handle this change by:

1. Updating the `Props` type to use Promise for params:
   ```typescript
   type Props = {
     params: Promise<{ locale: string }>;
   };
   ```

2. Using `await` to access the params values:
   ```typescript
   const { locale } = await params;
   ```

3. Using `getTranslations` instead of `useTranslations` for async server components, since React hooks cannot be used in async functions.

## Internationalization

The site supports English and Spanish languages. Translations are managed through JSON files in the `locales` directory.

- Server-side rendering for critical pages
- Static generation for content-heavy pages
- Proper metadata for all pages
