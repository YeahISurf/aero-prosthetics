## Vercel Deployment Process

This project uses a special deployment process for Vercel that requires keeping files in sync between your local development environment and the Vercel-specific files.

### Understanding the Deployment Setup

The project has two sets of files:
1. **Source files** (`src/` directory) - Used during local development
2. **Vercel-specific files** (`vercel-deploy/` directory) - Used during Vercel deployment

When you run `npm run dev` locally, you're using the files in the `src/` directory. However, when deploying to Vercel, a prebuild script (`scripts/prepare-vercel-build.cjs`) replaces certain files with versions from the `vercel-deploy/` directory.

This approach helps maintain ESLint compliance during the Vercel build process while allowing for more flexible development locally.

### Synchronization Commands

To ensure changes made to source files are properly reflected in the Vercel deployment, we've created synchronization scripts:

- `npm run sync-vercel` - Updates files in `vercel-deploy/` with your latest changes from `src/`
- `npm run check-sync` - Checks which files need to be synchronized without making changes

### Development Workflow

Follow this workflow to ensure your changes appear properly on both local development and Vercel deployment:

1. Make changes to files in the `src/` directory as normal
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Before committing/deploying, run `npm run sync-vercel` to update the Vercel-specific files
4. Commit all changes (both in `src/` and `vercel-deploy/`)
5. Push to deploy on Vercel

### Automated Checks

The system includes automated checks to help prevent deployment issues:

1. A Git pre-push hook (when implemented) checks if files are in sync before pushing
2. A GitHub workflow verifies synchronization during pull requests

For more detailed information about this system, see [VERCEL-SYNC.md](./VERCEL-SYNC.md).

## Image Management

The project includes an organized structure for managing image assets in the `/public/uploads/` directory:

- **`/uploads/hero/`** - Hero section images (homepage banners, page headers)
- **`/uploads/testimonials/`** - Testimonial user avatars and related images
- **`/uploads/services/`** - Service-specific images, icons, and illustrations
- **`/uploads/locations/`** - Location photos, facility images, maps
- **`/uploads/team/`** - Team member portraits and photos
- **`/uploads/gallery/`** - Miscellaneous gallery images and general purpose photos

For detailed usage instructions and naming conventions, see the [Image Uploads README](/public/uploads/README.md).

## Localization Best Practices

The website is fully internationalized with support for English and Spanish. Follow these guidelines when adding new content to ensure proper localization.

### Localization Structure

- **File Organization**: Translations are stored in JSON files in the `/locales` directory:
  - `en.json` - English translations
  - `es.json` - Spanish translations

- **JSON Structure**: Translation files follow a nested object structure that mirrors the site organization:
  ```json
  {
    "meta": { /* SEO metadata */ },
    "navigation": { /* Navigation labels */ },
    "home": {
      "hero": { /* Hero section content */ },
      "services": { /* Services section content */ },
      /* Other homepage sections */
    },
    /* Other page namespaces */
  }
  ```

- **Maintaining Parallel Structure**: When adding new content, ensure both language files have identical object structures with keys matching exactly.

### Adding New Content

1. **Always Add to Both Language Files**: When adding new content, update both `en.json` and `es.json` files with parallel structures.

2. **For Simple Text Content**:
   ```json
   // en.json
   "buttonLabel": "Contact Us"
   
   // es.json
   "buttonLabel": "ContÃ¡ctenos"
   ```

3. **For Structured Content** (arrays, objects):
   ```json
   // en.json
   "items": [
     {
       "id": 1,
       "title": "Our Services",
       "description": "Learn about our services"
     }
   ]
   
   // es.json
   "items": [
     {
       "id": 1,
       "title": "Nuestros Servicios",
       "description": "Conozca nuestros servicios"
     }
   ]
   ```

4. **TypeScript Interfaces**: Define interfaces for structured content to ensure type safety:
   ```typescript
   interface ServiceItem {
     id: number;
     title: string;
     description: string;
   }
   ```

### Component Implementation

1. **Basic Translation Usage**:
   ```tsx
   import { useTranslations } from 'next-intl';
   
   export default function MyComponent() {
     const t = useTranslations('namespace');
     
     return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
   }
   ```

2. **Accessing Structured Data**:
   ```tsx
   // For arrays or objects, use t.raw() with proper type casting
   const items = t.raw('items') as ServiceItem[];
   
   // Always include fallbacks for optional properties
   <span>{item.rating || 5}/5</span>
   ```

3. **Type Safety with TypeScript**:
   ```tsx
   // Define interfaces for complex data structures
   interface LocationDetails {
     title: string;
     address: string;
     // ... other properties
   }
   
   // Use type assertion for raw data
   const location = t.raw('location') as unknown as LocationDetails;
   ```

4. **Avoiding Hard-Coded Strings**: Never include hard-coded text directly in components. Always use the translation system:
   ```tsx
   // Wrong
   <button>Submit</button>
   
   // Right
   <button>{t('submit')}</button>
   ```

### Testing and Maintenance

1. **Verify Completeness**: Regularly compare language files to ensure all keys present in one are also present in the other.

2. **Test Both Languages**: When adding new features, always test the application in both English and Spanish.

3. **Language Toggle Testing**: Test the language toggle functionality to ensure content updates correctly when switching languages.

4. **Key Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive, hierarchical key names that reflect the content's location and purpose:
   ```
   home.services.title
   about.team.description
   contact.form.submitButton
   ```
