- Prioritize understanding the project structure before making changes
- For complex tasks, break down the solution into manageable components
- Examine utility files before writing redundant functions

## Code Quality Standards

- Write maintainable, readable code over clever solutions
- Include proper error handling for all user interactions and async operations
- Implement proper validation for all user inputs
