### Development Patterns

The codebase follows consistent development patterns to ensure maintainability and scalability:

#### Component Architecture

Components follow a hierarchy based on atomic design principles:

1. **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (Button, Input, Icon)
2. **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms (Card, Form Field, Navigation Item)
3. **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (Header, Footer, Hero Section)
4. **Templates**: Page layouts with content placeholders
5. **Pages**: Complete views with actual content

**Component Best Practices:**
- Single responsibility principle
- Props interface with explicit types
- Default props for optional parameters
- Semantic HTML elements as foundation
- ARIA attributes for accessibility
- CSS-in-JS using Tailwind utility classes
- Error boundaries for fault tolerance

**Sample Component Pattern:**
```tsx
// Button component example
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import { forwardRef } from "react";

// Define button variants using class-variance-authority
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary-500 text-white hover:bg-primary-600",
        outline: "border border-primary-500 text-primary-500 hover:bg-primary-50",
        ghost: "text-primary-500 hover:bg-primary-50",
        // Additional variants
      },
      size: {
        default: "h-10 py-2 px-4",
        sm: "h-8 px-3 text-xs",
        lg: "h-12 px-6 text-base",
        // Additional sizes
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "default",
    },
  }
);

// Define the props interface extending the variant props
export interface ButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {
  asChild?: boolean;
}

// Create the button component with forwardRef for ref passing
const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, asChild = false, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <button
        className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size }), className)}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    );
  }
);
Button.displayName = "Button";

export { Button, buttonVariants };
```

#### State Management

The application uses a tiered approach to state management based on scope:

1. **Component State**: React's `useState` and `useReducer` for local state
2. **Context API**: For shared state across component trees
3. **URL State**: Next.js router for global navigation state
4. **Server State**: Server components with data fetching

**State Management Patterns:**
- Prefer server components for static/rarely changing data
- Use client components only when interactivity is needed
- Leverage URL parameters for shareable state
- Implement context providers at appropriate levels
- Cache server data with SWR for optimistic updates

#### Form Handling

Forms implement a consistent pattern using React Hook Form with Yup validation:

```tsx
// Form implementation pattern
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { yupResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/yup";
import * as yup from "yup";

// Define validation schema
const schema = yup.object({
  name: yup.string().required("Name is required"),
  email: yup.string().email("Invalid email").required("Email is required"),
  message: yup.string().required("Message is required"),
}).required();

// Create form component
export default function ContactForm() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors, isSubmitting },
    reset
  } = useForm({
    resolver: yupResolver(schema)
  });
  
  // Form submission handler
  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    // Form submission logic
    // ...
    reset();
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

#### Internationalzation Patterns

Translation usage follows a consistent pattern:

```tsx
// Component with translations
import { useTranslations } from "next-intl";

export default function ServiceCard({ id }) {
  // Get translations from the services namespace
  const t = useTranslations("services");
  
  // Access nested translations
  const title = t(`${id}.title`);
  const description = t(`${id}.description`);
  
  // Access complex data
  const features = t.raw(`${id}.features`) as string[];
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <ul>
        {features.map((feature, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{feature}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Deployment Process

The project uses a specialized deployment process for Vercel to ensure optimal performance and reliability:

#### Architecture

The deployment architecture separates source code from deployment-specific files:

- **Source files**: Located in `src/` directory for local development
- **Vercel files**: Located in `vercel-deploy/` directory for deployment

This separation enables:
- Custom ESLint configurations for development vs. production
- Optimization of build processes for Vercel
- Clean separation of development and production concerns

#### Deployment Pipeline

The deployment pipeline includes several automated steps:

1. **Pre-Commit Checks**:
   - Linting with ESLint
   - Type checking with TypeScript
   - Unit tests with Jest

2. **Build Preparation**:
   - Synchronization of source and deployment files
   - Environment variable validation
   - Asset optimization

3. **Build Process**:
   - Next.js production build
   - Static page generation
   - Image optimization
   - CSS minification

4. **Deployment**:
   - Production deployment to Vercel Edge Network
   - Atomic deployments with instant rollback capability
   - Preview deployments for pull requests
   - Automatic internationalization routing

#### Synchronization Commands

```bash
# Update Vercel deployment files with source changes
npm run sync-vercel

# Check which files need synchronization
npm run check-sync

# Prepare files for Vercel build
npm run prebuild
```

#### Workflow Integration

The deployment process integrates with the development workflow:

1. Make changes to `src/` files
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Run synchronization with `npm run sync-vercel`
4. Commit all changes (both in `src/` and `vercel-deploy/`)
5. Push to trigger automated deployment

### Browser Compatibility

The website is tested and optimized across all major browsers and platforms:

**Supported Browsers:**
- **Chrome**: Version 120+
- **Firefox**: Version 120+
- **Safari**: Version 16+
- **Edge**: Version 120+
- **iOS Safari**: Version 16+
- **Android Chrome**: Version 120+

**Compatibility Strategy:**
- Progressive enhancement for core functionality
- Feature detection rather than browser detection
- Polyfills for critical features in older browsers
- Graceful degradation for advanced features
- Vendor prefixing handled via PostCSS Autoprefixer

**Testing Protocol:**
- Automated cross-browser testing with BrowserStack
- Visual regression testing across browsers
- Feature testing for critical user journeys
- Performance testing across platforms
